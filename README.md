**Google Search Clone - CS50 Project**

**Overview**

This project is a front-end implementation of Google's search functionalities, created as part of Harvard CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course. It includes separate pages for:

- Google Search

- Google Image Search

- Google Advanced Search

**Features**

- A search bar for Google Search with a clean, Google-like aesthetic.

- An "I'm Feeling Lucky" button that takes users directly to the first search result.

- Image Search functionality that directs users to Google Images.

- Advanced Search page with multiple fields for refining search queries.

- Navigation links to switch between search types.

- Styled using CSS to resemble Google’s design.

**Getting Started**
_**Downloading the Project**_
You can download the project files manually or by using the following command:

wget https://cdn.cs50.net/web/2020/spring/projects/0/search.zip

unzip search.zip

cd search

_**Running the Project**_

1. Open _index.html_ in your browser.

2. Use the navigation links at the top-right corner to switch between Search, Image Search, and Advanced Search.

3. Enter queries and click the respective buttons to perform searches.

**How It Works**
_**Google Search Page (index.html)**_
A simple search form with an input field and a submit button.

Clicking "Google Search" redirects to Google’s search results.

Clicking "I'm Feeling Lucky" redirects directly to the first search result.

_**Google Image Search (image.html)**_
A form designed to send search queries to Google Images.

Styled similarly to the standard search page.

_**Google Advanced Search (advanced.html)**_
A form with multiple input fields to refine search results:

"All these words"

"This exact word or phrase"

"Any of these words"

"None of these words"

Clicking "Advanced Search" submits the form to Google with the proper GET parameters.

**Styling**
The CSS ensures the search bar is centered and styled similarly to Google’s.

The Advanced Search button is blue with white text to match Google's design.

**Learning Outcomes**
By completing this project, I gained experience with:

HTML form handling

GET parameters in URLs

Basic CSS styling and layout techniques

Front-end web development fundamentals
