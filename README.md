**Google Search Clone - CS50 Project**

**Overview **

This project is a front-end implementation of Google's search functionalities, created as part of Harvard CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course. It includes separate pages for:

Google Search

Google Image Search

Google Advanced Search

**Features **
A search bar for Google Search with a clean, Google-like aesthetic.

An "I'm Feeling Lucky" button that takes users directly to the first search result.

Image Search functionality that directs users to Google Images.

Advanced Search page with multiple fields for refining search queries.

Navigation links to switch between search types.

Styled using CSS to resemble Google’s design.

**Getting Started**
**Downloading the Project**
You can download the project files manually or by using the following command:

wget https://cdn.cs50.net/web/2020/spring/projects/0/search.zip
unzip search.zip
cd search

**Running the Project
**
1. Open index.html in your browser.

2. Use the navigation links at the top-right corner to switch between Search, Image Search, and Advanced Search.

3. Enter queries and click the respective buttons to perform searches.

**How It Works
**
**Google Search Page (index.html)
**
A simple search form with an input field and a submit button.

Clicking "Google Search" redirects to Google’s search results.

Clicking "I'm Feeling Lucky" redirects directly to the first search result.

**Google Image Search (image.html)
**
A form designed to send search queries to Google Images.

Styled similarly to the standard search page.

**Google Advanced Search (advanced.html)
**
A form with multiple input fields to refine search results:

"All these words"

"This exact word or phrase"

"Any of these words"

"None of these words"

Clicking "Advanced Search" submits the form to Google with the proper GET parameters.

**Styling
**
The CSS ensures the search bar is centered and styled similarly to Google’s.

The Advanced Search button is blue with white text to match Google's design.

**Learning Outcomes
**
By completing this project, I gained experience with:

HTML form handling

GET parameters in URLs

Basic CSS styling and layout techniques

Front-end web development fundamentals
